## The Role of FUEL.

Fuelâ€™s shared sequencer network, powered by the Cosmos SDK, is designed to enable seamless cross-chain interactions. Holders of the Fuel token can actively participate in securing the network by staking or delegating their tokens to trusted validators within the Fuel ecosystem.

Fuel stands out for its exceptional speed and efficiency, making it ideal for rapidly processing cross-chain transactions. This capability empowers developers to build robust, low-latency cross-chain applications while addressing the challenges of fragmentation in multi-chain environments. With a shared sequencer that supports all Fuel rollups, the network offers a unified foundation for scalable block building.

Fuel will launch with 11 validators supporting the network. When you stake your Fuel tokens, you can delegate them to a validator, enabling you to earn staking rewards from the network. The entity operating the validators will take a percentage of these rewards as a fee.
